# Slack_Clone
This project was created as part of a ReactJS Challenge by Clever Programmer. Over 5 days, several hours a day were spent working on it and implementing various features. The result is a Slack clone that includes the main functionality of the real slack. The real-time chat in the different channels is my personal highlight. The backend is provided by Firebase.
